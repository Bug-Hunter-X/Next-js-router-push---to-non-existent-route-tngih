# Next.js router.push() to Non-Existent Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where using `router.push()` with an invalid route results in an error.  The error arises when attempting to navigate to a route that doesn't have a corresponding page file in the `pages` directory or is not properly handled within the routing configuration.

The solution involves ensuring that the target route is correctly defined in the `pages` directory, or implementing appropriate error handling using techniques such as a custom `404` page or conditional routing.
